I developed my random tester by first getting the variable state to a
value of 9, and then getting the string to the correct values.

inputChar()
To get the state variable to 9 I read through the ASCII table and found
that the characters in the testme() function regarding c had to be
between ASCII value 32 and 125.  To achieve this range I modulated a
randomly generated number by 94 and then added 32.  This achieved a state
value of 9 consistently and quickly.

inputString()
Next I got the string values to "reset" I found that the ASCII values
corresponded to decimal values between 101 and 116.  To achieve this range
I modulated a random number by 16 and added 101. This consistently produced
a string of "reset" within the span of 5 minutes, as per the assignment
instructions.
